# Introduction

There are a few principles, rules or universal laws in software development that guide architects, programmers, and anyone needing to design software.
This book lists some of those principles, although it's far from complete.
Still, the most important one should be listed here, and if you want to learn more, you can always read the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_principles).

## Why

I believe it is important to frequently come back to the basics.
Reminding ourselves of the synthesized knowledge that the entire developer community has gained over the years hopefully will help us to understand the code better.
Secondly, by designing this book I hope to get some practice in writing good code and applying and revising these principles.
If at any point I find myself doing the opposite, I will be happy to reconcile the theory and the praxis.
