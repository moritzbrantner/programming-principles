# Single Responsibility Principle

A class should never have more than one reason to change.

Long version: Every class should have a single responsibility, and that
responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. Responsibility can
be defined as a reason to change, so a class or module should have one, and only
one, reason to change.

**SRP** is the S in [SOLID](#solid).

## Why

- Maintainability: changes should be necessary only in one module or class.

## How

- Apply [Curly's Law](./curlys-law.md).
