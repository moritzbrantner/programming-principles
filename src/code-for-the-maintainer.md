# Code For The Maintainer

**Code for the maintainer**: code is not only coded once for execution, but also must be maintained, tested, and refactored.
Keep the people doing these jobs in mind, especially when it's yourself!

## Why

- Maintenance is by far the most expensive phase of any project.

## How

- _Be_ the maintainer.
- Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code is a violent
  psychopath who knows where you live.
- Always code and comment in such a way that if someone a few notches junior
  picks up the code, they will take pleasure in reading and learning from it.
