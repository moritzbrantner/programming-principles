# Keep things DRY

**Don't Repeat Yourself**: Every piece of knowledge must have a single,
unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in
just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by
distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by
abstracting out the varying parts.

## Why

- Duplication (inadvertent or purposeful duplication) can lead to maintenance
  nightmares, poor factoring, and logical contradictions.
- A modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in
  other logically unrelated elements.
- Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and
  uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.

## How

- Put business rules, long expressions, if statements, math formulas, metadata,
  etc. in only one place.
- Identify the single, definitive source of every piece of knowledge used in
  your system, and then use that source to generate applicable instances of that
  knowledge (code, documentation, tests, etc).
- Apply the
  [Rule of three](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)>).
