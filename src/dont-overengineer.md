# Don't Overengineer

## Why

- Real progress against the real problem is maximized if we just work on what
  the problem really is.
- Don't let your solution be too complex, but rather think only about things you absolutely need.

## How

- Ask yourself: "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?"
