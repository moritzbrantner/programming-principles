# Liskov Substitution Principle

The LSP is all about expected behavior of objects:

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
> without altering the correctness of that program.

**LSP** is the L in [SOLID](#solid).

There are two conceptions of the LSP:
1. interpreting "correctness" simply as syntactic correctness, and
2. interpreting "correctness" as "semantic correctness".

The latter is what was originally meant, but the former is what is usually used.
