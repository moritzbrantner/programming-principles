# KISS


**Keep It Simple, Stupid**: most systems work best if they are kept simple
rather than made complex.

## Why

- Less code is easier to read, easier to grasp, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
- The essence is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but
  when there is nothing left to take away.

## But

- Sometimes easy reading is hard writing. [Don't overengineer](./dont-overengineer.md) and avoid [premature optimization](./avoid-premature-optimization.md) for simplicity.
- Don't create fake simplicity by just refactoring your code into different places.
